# Pitch Correction - Real-Time Pitch Detection and Audio Feedback

A web application that detects flute pitch in real-time and generates corresponding piano notes for tuning reference. This tool helps musicians tune their instruments by providing instant audio feedback with low latency.

## Features

- **Real-time Pitch Detection**: Detects pitch from microphone input with high accuracy
- **Instant Piano Note Synthesis**: Generates piano notes at the detected frequency for tuning reference
- **Low Latency Audio Processing**: Achieves <50ms latency for responsive feedback
- **Continuous Audio Output**: Maintains audio playback during sustained notes
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays detected frequency, note name, and tuning accuracy
- **Modern Web Interface**: Clean, responsive React-based UI

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **React 19.1.1** - UI framework for building the user interface
- **TypeScript 5.9.3** - Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience
- **Vite 7.1.7** - Fast build tool with HMR for rapid development

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API** - Native browser API for all audio operations (no external audio libraries)
- **AudioWorklet** - High-priority audio processing thread for low-latency operations
- **MediaStream API** - Microphone access and audio input capture

### Development Tools
- **ESLint 9.37.0** - Code linting and quality enforcement
- **Prettier 3.6.2** - Code formatting
- **TypeScript ESLint 8.45.0** - TypeScript-specific linting rules

### Build & Development
- **@vitejs/plugin-react 5.0.4** - Vite plugin for React with Fast Refresh
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment for development tools

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with Web Audio API support:
  - Chrome/Edge 89+
  - Firefox 88+
  - Safari 14.1+

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pitch-correction
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server with hot module replacement
- `npm run build` - Build production-ready application
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality

## How It Works

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Microphone Input**: Captures audio from the user's microphone using MediaStream API
2. **Pitch Detection**: Analyzes audio using autocorrelation or YIN algorithm to detect fundamental frequency
3. **Note Synthesis**: Generates piano notes using Web Audio API oscillators with harmonic content
4. **Audio Output**: Plays synthesized notes through speakers/headphones with minimal latency

### Key Technical Features

- **AudioWorklet Processing**: Runs pitch detection in a separate high-priority thread to avoid blocking the main thread
- **Frequency Range**: Optimized for flute range (200-2500 Hz)
- **Additive Synthesis**: Creates piano-like timbre using multiple harmonic oscillators
- **ADSR Envelope**: Shapes audio with Attack-Decay-Sustain-Release for realistic piano sound
- **Feedback Prevention**: Implements gating and amplitude thresholds to prevent audio feedback loops

## Browser Compatibility

The application requires modern browser features:

- **Web Audio API** - For audio processing and synthesis
- **MediaStream API** - For microphone access
- **AudioWorklet** - For low-latency audio processing
- **HTTPS** - Required for microphone access (except on localhost)

### Recommended Browsers
- Chrome/Edge 89+ (best Web Audio API support)
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14.1+ (requires user gesture for AudioContext)

## Performance

- **Latency**: <50ms end-to-end (input to output)
- **Pitch Accuracy**: >95% within 5 cents
- **CPU Usage**: <25% of single core
- **Update Rate**: Real-time frequency updates at audio rate

## Development

### Code Quality

The project uses ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting:

- TypeScript for type safety
- React hooks for state management
- Functional components throughout
- Minimal comments (code should be self-documenting)

### Testing Approach

1. **Component Testing**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Testing**: Verify complete audio pipeline
3. **User Testing**: Test with actual instrument input
4. **Performance Testing**: Measure latency and accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **Microphone not working**: Check browser permissions and ensure HTTPS connection
- **High latency**: Try using Chrome/Edge for best performance
- **Inaccurate pitch detection**: Ensure quiet environment and proper microphone positioning
- **Audio feedback**: Use headphones or reduce output volume
